# Yugo - Container Engine

Yugo is a container engine with the objective of running "any" application regardless of the OS. It's a part of a bigger project that will be announced later on.

## MVP - Minimal Viable Product 

At this very time, yugo is as crapy as it looks. But it works! It can create containers and that's the main goal at this very stage. 

## Status 

Right now working on version 0. The one you get a working container engine with basic commands like `setup  build  run  remove  list`, a secure way to use it on
your computer without screwing nothing up, a organized codebase and some nice features. Stay tunned for any updates.
